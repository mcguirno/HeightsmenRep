The HeightsmenRep app is a way for the Heightsmen of Boston College, my all-male acapella group to properly keep tabs on what songs we have sang in the past and what former members had earned the soloist for them.
In our group, the process for song selections to add to our repretoire is simple, yet requires a lot of record keeping: Around 5 songs are added to the repretoire each semester. 
Then, there is an audition process to determine who earns the solo. Once that soloist graduates, they "take that song with them" and it cannot be brought into the group again.
Therefore, it is exceedingly important to keep a record of what songs have been sung to determine that we do not accidentally duplicate, especially with 30 years of songs in the catalogue.
Previously, we used a shared google sheet but it has been difficult to share these with all the respective members and ensure proper data usage. I've created a duplicate of it that can be viewed here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xMjcw-e8iV9Wb6yHI8EQz4pYtPEBKVInImAmBUJB0Is/edit?usp=sharing
Now into the app:

This is the homepage that can be sorted in a number of ways from alphabetical to chronological. Users can click on each song to edit the corresponding info about each song, as seen here:

In addition, Heightsmen alumni can view what songs are currently within our repretoire very easily with the "Current" sort option:

I hope to share this app soon to allow our alumni network to properly use its capabilities.
